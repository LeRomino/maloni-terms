# Maloni Terms of Service/Privacy Policy

Use of Maloni
By inviting Maloni to your Discord server, you and your members grant Maloni permission to store the following information about you:
Your Discord avatar-url

Maloni will not automatically store information. In the event you use a command to store extra data, you will approve of it by typing it in as a command. These are used to identify you and give you access to the Lemony infrastructure.
1.2 Liability
We are in no way liable of potential data loss. In the case we suffer a major data loss, we will post a announcement in our Discord server.
1.3 Tracking
In events you break any of the general guidelines your userid may be tracked to exclude you from using Maloni.
1.4 What we do to protect your data
We make sure our database runs locally and has no way of directly communicating outside the network. Access to the machine is secured with ssh-keys and a unique ssh port. All our database queries are using prepared statements to protect your data from sqlinjection. If you don't feel safe or have an issue with our setup please contact us at romainairblock@gmail.com.
1.5 How you can protect your data
You can email us (romainairblock@gmail.com) or contact us through discord to get your data deleted. We may ask for proof of ownership of the account when using email. Having your data deleted multiple times might result in a ban from using our bot and your userid being stored. This way we can ensure that the users of our bot know why Lemony is not working as it should when users that delete their data join their server.
2. Cheating
We do not condone the use of general cheats, hacks, bots or any type of malicious or exploitative behaviour. This includes but does not limit to:
Using “self bots” to interact with Maloni.
Abusing glitches to personally gain from it.
Abusing our open source platform to exploit systems.
